What it is:
A bronzer for the face and body that delivers a streak-free finish.

What it does:
This super fine powder is baked on a terra cotta disc for 24 hours and then hand-finished by a factory full of motherly Italian women who are concerned with the safety of your skin. Because it is cooked rather than pressed, it will even regain its micro-fine texture if you've applied it wet for a more dramatically bronzed look.

What else you need to know:
The new packaging with a Moroccan-inspired moon-and-stars motif contains the same formula Urban Decay has built this product's following on. Selecting the shade you want is now even easier–variations in the color of the compact match the color inside. Tips: Apply Baked Bronzer to your face or body. Try using a small wet brush to deliver rich, concentrated color to eyes and lips too.
