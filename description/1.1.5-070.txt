What it does:
Givenchy Mister Mat Mattifying Foundation Primer is a soft skin primer that can be used alone or under makeup for a velvety smooth complexion. The lightweight fluid softens and hydrates with silicone gum extracts; and plant extracts work to control sebum production, which provides a long-lasting matte effect that remains light enough to let skin breathe. The subtle light-blue pearlescent shimmers counteract a dull look and minimize the appearance of large pores, leaving skin looking bright and glowing with health.
