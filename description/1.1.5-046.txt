What it is:
A color-correcting primer that preps the face for makeup application and wear. 

What it does:
This lightweight, oil-free primer helps create a smooth, even canvas for foundation. It color corrects for a range of complexion concerns, so makeup glides on evenly and stays true. 

What else you need to know: 
Which one to use depends on your skin. There’s a Superprimer for redness, dullness, discoloration, and sallowness. If you have more than one skin concern, we recommend using a Superprimer to address one issue and a foundation to address the other. 

If you simply want allover smoothing before foundation, try Clinique's Universal Superprimer, which preps skin beautifully for makeup. It is translucent, so wearing it alone is an option if you’re pressed for time, but for best results, team Superprimer with foundation for a flawless look.
