The unique texture of MAKE UP FOR EVER Powder Blush is due to its high pigment density, which makes it last and last. That's why makeup artists love it! You can obtain maximum coverage with the Matte texture; the Semi-Matte has a silky, satiny feel; and the iridescent shades give a transparent sheen.

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
