What it is:
A creamy foundation with SPF protection.

What it does:
Givenchy Photo'Perfexion Fluid Foundation SPF 20 PA+++ works like a concealer to correct imperfections, smooth the skin's texture, and even out the complexion. With the expertise and speed of a digital retoucher, Photo'Perfexion conceals dark shadows and sallow complexions. It goes on smooth and velvety every time and delivers a flawless finish—minus the heavy, cakey feeling.
