What it is:
A selection of pure cosmetic pigments for eyes, cheeks, or lips. 

What it does:
This is 100% pure, uncut pigments. Makeup reduced to its most basic essential: color itself. This professional, matte-finish powder works alone if used sparingly. But, for truly optimal use, mix into other cosmetic bases including body lotions, loose powders, and OCC Skin Primer for a gel eyeshadow finish. 

What else you need to know:
OCC Pure Cosmetic Pigments are available in six artist-approved, basic-necessity shades.
