What it is:
A mineral pressed powder that reduces redness.

What it is formulated to do:
This remarkable product is lab-certified to visually reduce redness and broken capillaries on contact. Practically invisible, the moment you brush it on it seems to disappear. Clinique's "applied colour science" led to a nuanced formula that conceals discoloration, making visible redness and broken capillaries seem to vanish. But at its heart, this master of disguise is also an advanced treatment. It calms redness with a unique complex that includes caffeine and the extracts of magnolia bark, mushroom, and grapefruit peel. 

What else you need to know:
Under the care and cover of this product, skin keeps its cool and feels comfortable. It is ideal for skin types with reactive redness or rosacea. This product is gentle enough for the eye area, allergy tested, and 100% free of fragrances, oil, and talc.
