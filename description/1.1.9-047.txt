What it is:
A one-shade-fits-all powder blush in a natural bronze hue. 

What it does:
With just a hint of subtle shimmer, this bronzer produces a customized sun-kissed glow on cheeks. The “intuitive” powder can also be used as an all-over bronzer by applying a light dusting over the areas of the face where the sun hits, such as the cheeks, nose and forehead, creating a back-from-the-beach golden glow.

- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Synthetic Dyes
- Petrochemicals
