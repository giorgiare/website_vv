What it is:
An update of Bobbi Brown’s iconic stick foundation. 

What it does:
Still color correcting and incredibly versatile, this formula is creamier and yet even more lightweight than the original and blends seamlessly into skin to create the perfect nude canvas. Intended to mimic the look of healthy skin, it can be worn all over the face or just to touch up where needed. The revolutionary clear base allows for ultimate skin match and skintone correct shades that are completely color true for eight hours of water-, sweat-, and humidity-resistant wear. 

What else you need to know:
