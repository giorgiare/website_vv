What it is:
A whisper-light powder to bring a snap of illuminating color to face, eyes, and body. 

What it does:
With her passion for natural, healthy-looking skin, Laura wanted to create an innovative product to add a youthful glow to the face and body. This modern, wearable pearl leaves skin gleaming without being too frosty or metallic, while lightly fine-milled French “Cashmere” Talc provides incredibly soft texture. With light-reflecting properties that blend together to give the skin a healthy all-over glow, it brightens the eyes, cheeks, and body with a hint of natural color and light.

What else you need to know:
This product is dermatologist- and allergy-tested. It is fragrance-free and suitable for all skin types.
