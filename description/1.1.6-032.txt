What it is:
A weightless finishing powder with a luminous, demi-matte Naked finish that blends flawlessly to set makeup and cut shine. 

What it does:
The next evolution in Naked Skin, this oil-free powder is virtually invisible on skin and has a silky texture that feels amazing. Optical blurring pigments instantly minimize imperfections, diminish shine, and create a stunning soft-focus effect that looks professionally retouched. Unlike powders that leave skin looking chalky or cakey, this powder imparts a radiant complexion and natural-looking coverage. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
This formula works beautifully with Naked Skin Beauty Balm or Naked Skin Liquid Makeup, enhancing the already-luminous finish. The gunmetal and champagne custom compact features a Naked-embossed push button. The top compartment includes a full-size and a separate compartment underneath holds the applicator sponge.
