What else you need to know:
"This is perfect for the girl on the go! I can do my makeup in seconds with this 2-in-1 pen and it’s so versatile: I use it all over my face as foundation and concealer, or simply as concealer with my favorite Lorac foundation. You can also use it as a spotting technique to cover under eye-circles and imperfections. Tip: use CF5 Peach on medium or olive skins to lighten and brighten under eye-circles (peach corrects and conceals blue). And with a built-in brush that does all the work for you, there’s no need to spend money on a foundation brush. It is truly the fastest and easiest way to do your makeup and make your skin look picture-perfect.”—Carol Shaw, Creator of LORAC
