What it is:
A four-color blush with a matte texture.

What it does:
This new formula contains a higher pigment concentration that delivers immediate color payoff on the cheeks. As with the complete Prismes concept, the "quatuor" (or 4 shades) may be used alone or mixed together for a made-to-measure look. The blush's upper right shade is the reference shade for the final result when mixing altogether. Get just the touch of color needed to shape and add dimension to the face!
