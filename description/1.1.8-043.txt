What it is:
A luxurious cheek shade that glides effortlessly onto the skin. 

What it does:
Highlight cheekbones and add depth and contour to the complexion with this blendable blush available in an array of luminous colors. Cheeks will look radiant with a subtle glow that perfectly compliments smooth, perfected skin.

What else you need to know:
"There are two ways to wear blusher. For day, brush soft rose or peach color high on the cheekbones in a circular motion, using a large powder brush. This will give the look of flushed cheeks signifying health and outdoor activity. For evening, contour the face with a blush that is slightly darker than natural skin color. Brush contour along the cheekbones, temples, and chin for a subtly sculpted effect."–Pat McGrath, Global Creative Advisor
