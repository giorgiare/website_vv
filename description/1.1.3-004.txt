What it is:
A perfect blend of skincare and makeup that helps control oil-breakthrough and gives skin a sheer hint of color for a healthy, natural glow. 

What it does:
This lightweight formula provides ideal protection from the sun’s harmful, damaging rays with broad spectrum SPF 20 UVB/UVA sunscreen. It also controls oil-breakthrough with hydration to prevent dryness and soften and ease fine, dry lines. An antioxidant complex of vitamins C and E acts as a free radical scavenger to protect the skin from even the most aggressive effects of the environment, all while extremely long-wearing color stays true and wears evenly in a natural, semi-matte finish. Non-comedogenic and dermatologist- and allergy-tested to minimize the risk of irritation, it is perfect for all skin types, including sensitive ones.
