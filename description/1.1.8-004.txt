What it is:
A silky bronzer, highlighter, and blush in a sleek, travel-ready compact. 

What it does:
Use these pressed powders individually or blend them together to create just the right effect—and let this seemingly straight-laced trio morph into a tangled color love-fest. Then bask in the radiant glow and let people wonder what you’ve been up to. Urban Decay’s micronized, jet-milled formula has a luxe, featherlight texture that feels amazing on your skin. And the finish? Flawless. Light-diffusing particles enhance and perfect to give your skin a fresh, glowy look…even when your late-night antics have you feeling anything but. The color is intensely pigmented yet blends beautifully—and the universal shades are versatile enough for any skintone. 

What else you need to know:
All shades are full size and come in a sleek case with an easy-open magnetic closure and a mirror that is compact enough for travel or mid-date touchups.
