These multipurpose pencils hide spots and blotches, minimize lines and wrinkles, and reshape the contour of lips. Concealer Pencils blend like a cream but correct with the precision of a pencil. Each crayon has two different colored tips for more color combination possibilities.
Dany's Tip: "These pencils are useful on many occasions. Apply the lighter shade inside the eye when you look tired to hide signs of fatigue."

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
