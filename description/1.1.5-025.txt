What it is:
A lightweight, creamy gel that creates an invisible barrier between skin and makeup to prime your face for color. 

What it does:
Worn under foundation, this oil-free Primer creates a smooth, flawless canvas for application, allowing foundation to glide on easily and stay fresh and color-true for hours. Ideal for oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin types, it helps mattify and control oil. It’s the first step to Laura’s “Flawless Face.” This dermatologist-tested, non-comedogenic product contains the antioxidant green tea extract; vitamins A, C, and E; and cucumber that helps sooth and refresh the skin. 

What else you need to know:
Just as a painter primes a canvas, Foundation Primer—the original—was created by Laura Mercier in 1995 to prime the skin. After creating the industry’s first primer, she “reinvented” it and made another version perfect for oilier, overactive skins and customers who prefer a less emollient texture. She added oil-controlling ingredients for a semi-matte, long-wear finish. The colorless gel acts as a buffer to outside elements, while vitamins A, C, and E act as antioxidants and protect the skin from the harmful, aging effects of the environment. It also contains high water-content and addresses surface dehydration around active blemishes.
