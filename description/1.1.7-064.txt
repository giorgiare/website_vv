What it is:
A long-wearing concealer that completely hides redness, blemishes, and dark circles under the eyes.

What it does:
This lightweight, crease-resistant concealer in a mini mirrored compact completely camouflages redness, blemishes, and dark circles under the eyes. Stable vitamin C brightens dark circles and decreases hyperpigmentation from acne, scars, and UV damage while increasing collagen levels and repairing skin. This formula starts as a cream for optimal blendability, then dries to a powder finish to stay put all day long. It also works effectively as an eye primer for long-lasting eye color. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
