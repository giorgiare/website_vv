What it is:
A skin-perfecting and silicone-free face primer enriched with ultranourishing Greek yogurt for the smoothest makeup application and long-lasting wear. 

What it is formulated to do:
Recommended for all skin types and ideal for sensitive skin, this incredibly nourishing, silicone-free primer is powered by a Greek yogurt concentrate with two and a half times the protein of regular yogurt. This super-protein is blended into a breathable gel texture that glides onto skin leaving a dewy finish, leaving skin with a perfectly soft, even canvas for the smoothest makeup application and long-lasting wear. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 

What else you need to know:
Unlike silicone-based primers that sit on top of skin, all KORRES Primers are silicone-free and skin-compatible so they melt into skin and work from the inside out to improve skin texture for smoother makeup application and longer wear. Makeup stays locked in place and won’t slick off throughout the day. 

Research results:
- 94% of women felt skin was more hydrated and healthier-looking 
- 94% of women saw visible improvements in skin’s texture and smoothness
