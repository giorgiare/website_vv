What it is:
A weightless setting spray that helps makeup stay put, controls oil, and deflects surface shine. 

What it does:
Oily skin has met its match! De-Slick mists on weightlessly to control oil, deflect surface shine, and keep skin looking beautifully matte. High-tech ingredients help keep foundation, shadow, and blush from smudging, sliding, or fading—so you hardly ever need to touch up. Developed in an exclusive partnership with SKINDINÄVIA, this groundbreaking, clinically tested formula features patented Temperature Control Technology that actually lowers the temperature of your makeup to help it stay put and keep skin looking smooth, but never shiny. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
Unlike similar products on the market that feel sticky or tight on your skin, the sprayer delivers a microfine mist that goes on so light, you’ll hardly feel it—and once you’ve applied it, you won’t even know it’s there. 

Research results:
In a 7-day clinical study of De-Slick:
- 100% of participants said De-Slick helped prevent makeup meltdown
- Over 90% said their makeup looked less shiny, didn’t slide, and rarely needed to be touched up
- 85% said De-Slick is the longest-lasting oil-control product they’ve ever used
