What it is:
A lip and cheek balm that instinctively harmonizes with every skintone for a customized, radiant flush of color.

What it does:
Hydra Sparkling Magic Lip & Cheek Balm's innovative formula moisturizes and provides a flushed tint to lips and cheeks. It contains pigments that react with the skin's humidity to create a personalized hint of color to the lips and a delicate glow to the cheeks. Hyaluronic acid spheres bring moisture and fill in the dehydration lines and, by capturing water, these water-soaked spheres swell to increase the volume—thus providing a plumping action on lips and cheeks. Lips and cheeks are lipid-replenished by Luffa Oil, which is rich in fatty acids, and the glossy cream contains a texture with a melting and softening sensation.

What else you need to know:
This balm is fragranced with the Gloss Interdit perfume.
