What it is:
A weightless setting spray that keeps makeup looking just-applied for up to 16 hours. 

What it does:
Is makeup meltdown ruining your midnight mojo? Mist on this weightless spray to give your makeup serious staying power. Developed in an exclusive partnership with SKINDINÄVIA, this groundbreaking, clinically tested formula is suitable for all skin types and features patented Temperature Control Technology. It actually lowers the temperature of your makeup to keep foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and concealer in place—even in hot and humid or cold and windy conditions. The result? Smoother-looking skin and vibrant makeup that lasts all day (or night) without melting, cracking, fading, or settling into fine lines. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
Unlike similar products on the market that feel sticky or tight on your skin, the sprayer delivers a microfine mist that goes on so light, you’ll hardly feel it—and once you’ve applied it, you won’t even know it’s there. 

Research results:
In a 7-day clinical study of All Nighter:
- 78% of participants said All Nighter helped their makeup last for 16 hours
- Over 80% said their makeup not only looked better, it stayed on better (even in the T-zone) without settling into fine lines
- Whether they had combination, oily, or dry skin, 88% or more said All Nighter was the best product to help their makeup last
