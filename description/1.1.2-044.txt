What else you need to know:
Beauty Balms or BB Creams were originally developed as a perfect post-procedure cream used to treat, hydrate, prime, protect, and camouflage the skin. Great for all skin types including those with sensitive skin, these versatile “five-in-one” formulas are designed to do it all: treat with high levels of active skincare ingredients; moisturize and smooth dehydrated skin; prime and perfect skin’s surface; camouflage and color correct the skintone; and protect skin from the sun with SPF. They can be used as a last step for their skincare benefits or used on their own as an instant beautifier.

This dermatologist-tested foundation contains chamomile extract, which treats and heals dry skin; vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps prevent premature signs of aging; and vitamins A and E, antioxidants that fight free radical damage. It's also formulated with mineral pigments known for their soothing and softening properties and sodium hyaluronate for its moisture retention properties. It does not contain sodium laurel sulfate or petrolatum.
