A five-in-one complete coverage beauty balm that perfects, mattifies, primes, and moisturizes. 

What it is formulated to do:

This is the first complete coverage beauty balm that evens skintone and banishes imperfections with an air-buffed second-skin finish. The result? Flawless-looking skin. The cream-to-powder formula provides long-lasting, complete, and buildable coverage with the benefits of five products: it perfects, mattifies, primes, and moisturizes. Blend this lightweight formulation onto your skin with a snap-in-place Air Buff Brush specifically created with Too Faced’s signature cruelty-free Teddy Bear Hair. Smart ingredients such as rose fruit refine the appearance of pores and create matte coverage, while star fruit leaf moisturizes, leaving a beautiful complexion.

- Parabens

What else you need to know:
Beauty Balms or BB Creams were originally developed as a perfect post-procedure cream used to treat, hydrate, prime, protect, and camouflage the skin. Great for all skin types including those with sensitive skin, these versatile “five-in-one” formulas are designed to do it all: treat with high levels of active skincare ingredients; moisturize and smooth dehydrated skin; prime and perfect skin’s surface; camouflage and color correct the skintone; and protect skin from the sun with SPF. They can be used as a last step for their skincare benefits or used on their own as an instant beautifier.
