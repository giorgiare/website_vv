What it is:
A foundation with light-responsive technology for an even, luminous finish. 

What it does:
Makeup, reimagined: this foundation utilizes 100 percent Liquid Light Technology for a totally natural, radiant finish. The microscopic, gel-covered pigments mimic photo filters to blur imperfections. This HD formula completely evens out skin, but is undetectable to the naked eye. This oil-free foundation works with all undertones and builds from sheer to medium coverage.
