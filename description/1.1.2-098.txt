What it is: 
A rich and creamy, full-coverage, transformative mousse foundation 

What it does: 
Reveal skin’s ideal complexion with this nutrient-rich, full-coverage foundation that transforms from a lightweight creamy mousse into a matte, feather-light powder for a flawless finish. Infused with hydrating ingredients like coconut water and amino acids, this formula derives its velvety texture and transformative properties from Marc’s exclusive Melt-On™ technology. 

What else you need to know: 
The secret to Marc Jacobs’ proprietary Melt-On™ Technology is an innovative blend of dynamic ingredients—including Sweet Orange extract—that enable the formula to glide on smoothly, melt on contact, and transform into a featherweight, full-coverage powder.
