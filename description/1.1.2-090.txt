What it is:
A radiant matte liquid foundation.

What it does:
Eclat Matissime is a fluid foundation featuring a new radiant matte finish that reveals the fine texture and glow of the skin. The gentle formula, which features SPF 20 PA ++ protection, respects the delicate balance of the complexion for a natural yet long-lasting result.

What else you need to know:
Some matifying foundations absorb sebum too intensely. The skin is artificially dried making the skin produce more sebum through a boomerang effect. Eclat Matissime is formulated with silica beads structured to optimize the absorption of oil and moisture while allowing the skin to breathe for improved comfort.
