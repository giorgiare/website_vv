What it is:
A loose powder with a luminous, demi-matte Naked finish. 

What it does:
Blur flaws, set makeup, and cut shine with this weightless formula that feels amazingly silky on the skin. Designed to be virtually invisible, Urban Decay’s high-tech, light-reflecting formula fools the eye with optical blurring, seemingly airbrushing away imperfections and creating a soft-focus effect that looks professionally retouched. This creamy, buildable, jet-milled formula applies beautifully, never looks chalky or cakey, and won’t settle into fine lines. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
This product does not contain alcohol or fragrance. Naked Skin Loose Finishing Powder comes in a generously sized jar that’s perfect to keep on your vanity yet still compact enough for travel. However you use it, a custom gunmetal sifter (shaped like the UD icon) dispenses just the right amount of powder each time.
