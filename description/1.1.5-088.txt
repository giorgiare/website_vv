What it is:
A lightweight, creamy gel that creates an invisible barrier between skin and makeup to prime your face for color. 

What it does:
Worn under foundation, this good-for-skin Mineral Primer creates a smooth, flawless canvas for application, allowing foundation to glide on easily and stay fresh and color-true for hours. Ideal for all skin types, even sensitive, it nourishes with a blend of vitamins and minerals to visibly improve the look of skin. It’s the first step to Laura’s “Flawless Face.” Dermatologist-tested and non-comedogenic, it contains antioxidant vitamins A and E. 

What else you need to know:
Just as a painter primes a canvas, Foundation Primer—the original—was created by Laura Mercier in 1995 to prime the skin. After creating the industry’s first primer, she “reinvented” it and made another version perfect for drier, dehydrated skin and customers who needed more hydration, moisture, and conditioning. She added soothing hydrators that offer anti-inflammatory benefits, help hold water in the skin, and nourish with a moisture-rich vitamin formula. The colorless gel acts as a buffer to outside elements, while vitamins A, C, and E act as antioxidants and protect the skin from the harmful, aging effects of the environment.
