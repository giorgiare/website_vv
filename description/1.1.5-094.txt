What it is:
An creamy opalescent skin primer.

What it does:
This universal opalescent primer reveals and intensifies radiance to enhance the complexion. Its long-lasting creamy formula refines pores and smooths the complexion for healthy-looking skin. Highly moisturizing, it leaves the skin comfortable and protected. Use it either under a Givenchy foundation to set makeup while illuminating it or alone for a radiant smoothed effect.

What else you need to know:
The formula’s soft-focus particles diffuse light reflections so that skin looks smooth and flawless. The combination of a high-performance emulsifier and numerous polyols moisturizes the skin. The skin cells are fully hydrated and therefore more transparent, which enhances the skin’s capacity to reflect light and effectively boosts skin radiance.
