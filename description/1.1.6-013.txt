What it is:
A creamy pressed powder that gives skin a naturally luminous finish. 

What it does:
Enjoy smooth application with no build up on skin. This lightweight formula glides over skin for a soft-focus effect and a natural healthy glow. A unique blend of pure pearl powders and mica add luminosity, while minerals; vitamins A, C, and E; aloe vera; antioxidants; and other skin-nourishing ingredients help protect skin against environmental stressors. A smooth texture visibly diminishes the look of fine lines and wrinkles and stays color-true, leaving skin looking smooth, natural, and flawless in a sheer to medium coverage that is water-resistant. Each portable, travel-friendly compact contains a dual-sided sponge for mistake-proof touch-ups or buildable foundation coverage. 

What else you need to know:
Pearl powders are rich in amino acids, calcium, and magnesium, which help smooth out the appearance of the skin, while rice lipids, jojoba esters, and amino acids promote a healthy appearance. This dermatologist-tested, non-comedogenic product is free of oil and fragrance and is perfect for all skin types, even sensitive ones.
