What it is:
A split-pan compact containing two concentrations of the same concealer shade for customizable coverage.

What it does:
Ensuring a flawless match with every application, this dual-sided concealer holds two separate formulations. On the left is a super heavy duty, slightly drier consistency to cover anything from blemishes to scars and birthmarks. On the right side is a slightly more sheer, creamier formulation of the same shade, ideal for under-the-eye areas and blending over larger areas of the face. 

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
