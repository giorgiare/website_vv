What it is:
A three-in-one concealer that soothes and conditions skin, eliminates imperfections, and illuminates complexion. 

What it does:
Awaken the glow, renew the radiance, and restore the glamour with the Perfect Finish Concealer, the ultimate luxurious makeup essential by Dolce & Gabbana. The creamy weightless formula moisturizes, soothes, and blends naturally, concealing flaws and every kind of imperfection. Illuminating the skin with light-reflecting radiance pigments, this concealer achieves a natural, impeccable glow. 

What else you need to know:
"For complete coverage, apply dots of concealer to darker areas—under the eyes, the sides of the nose, corners of the mouth—and other minor flaws. Blend smoothly and consistently with a sweep or two of the blush. Awaken skin's radiance by gently applying concealer to areas where light would naturally illuminate. Trace a path through the center of the face, starting from the middle of the forehead to the bridge of the nose to the point of the chin; then add highlights on upper cheekbones. Blend softly on upper lids and apply carefully to darker areas below and around the eyes. The eyes will appear larger and more radiant. Fine lines will be diminished; signs of fatigue will vanish."—Pat McGrath, Global Creative Advisor
