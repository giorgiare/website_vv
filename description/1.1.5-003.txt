What it is:
A professional balm that minimizes the appearance of pores. 

What it does:
Quickly minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines and help makeup stay put with this priming phenomenon.

It’s so translucent, no one will know you’re wearing anything! 

What else you need to know:
The oil-free formula contains vitamin E, which is known to protect skin from free radicals.
