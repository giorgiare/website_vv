What it is:
A compact foundation featuring buildable, long-wearing coverage. 

What it does:
Teint Couture Compact Foundation comes in a luxurious case that opens to reveal two powders: a flesh shade plus a light-as-a-cloud pink for a “rosy skin” effect, like a blush brought on by a cool breeze, a compliment…or a kiss. A highly sophisticated product whose application is child’s play—even women who say they don’t know how to use foundation are going to be surprised!

An exclusive atomization technology guarantees an ultrasoft, ultrafine texture for a made-to-measure second-skin effect with no sensation of excess buildup. The skin beautifying blend, with antioxidant vitamin E and an SPF 10 sunscreen, features a special brightener formulated with pink pigments and incredibly pure pearlescent particles. The result? A perfectly, lastingly unified complexion with a silky, velvety finish and a bare skin feel—and that remains impeccable all day long! Teint Couture Long-Wearing Compact Foundation gives women the skin they’ve dreamed about: smooth and radiant, natural and yet glamorous, enlivened with subtle touches of light.

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
