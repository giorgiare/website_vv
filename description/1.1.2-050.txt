What it is:
An all-in-one moisturizer, treatment, and foundation with SPF protection. 

What it is formulated to do:
- This formula combines moisturizer, treatment, broad spectrum SPF, and a lightweight foundation 
- Features SPF 35 sun protection 

This multitasking cream moisturizes, perfects, and protects—instantly and over time. Inspired by a skincare/makeup hybrid that’s a cult favorite in Asia, this formula combines water-attracting molecules to boost hydration, light-reflective pearls to brighten dull skin, botanical extracts and caffeine to reduce discoloration and redness, pore-refining peptides such as Argireline Peptide to minimize fine lines and fight wrinkles, and broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection with SPF 35 and antioxidants to fend off future damage. This in-between skin perfecter for normal to oily skin also creates a smooth canvas for flawless foundation application and fights shine to give a natural-looking matte finish. Consider it your skin’s new best friend. 

What else you need to know:
Beauty Balms or BB Creams were originally developed as a perfect post-procedure cream used to treat, hydrate, prime, protect, and camouflage the skin. Great for all skin types including those with sensitive skin, these versatile “five-in-one” formulas are designed to do it all: treat with high levels of active skincare ingredients; moisturize and smooth dehydrated skin; prime and perfect skin’s surface; camouflage and color correct the skintone; and protect skin from the sun with SPF. They can be used as a last step for their skincare benefits or used on their own as an instant beautifier.
