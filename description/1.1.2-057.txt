What it is:
A five-in-one beauty balm that minimizes the appearance of pores, lines, wrinkles, and redness instantly for skin that looks firmer in eight weeks. 

What it is formulated to do:
- Multitasking antiaging formula to produce a beautiful, radiant complexion 
- Features SPF 20 sun protection 
- Comes in one universal shade 

Blur flaws in seconds and get serious antiaging benefits in as little as eight weeks. This lightweight, velvety, oil-free miracle works instantly and over the long term. Naked Skin Beauty Balm is invisible on your skin (zero rub-off): the universal shade glides on and dries down to a translucent, flawless finish that works on most skintones. While many beauty balms are tinted to provide coverage, Naked Skin diffuses light with high-tech pigments to give you amazing, natural, naked-looking skin that keeps getting better every week. Unlike a lot of beauty balms, Naked Skin delivers measurable antiaging benefits—and the claims to prove it. 

What else you need to know:
Beauty Balms or BB Creams were originally developed as a perfect post-procedure cream used to treat, hydrate, prime, protect, and camouflage the skin. Great for all skin types including those with sensitive skin, these versatile “five-in-one” formulas are designed to do it all: treat with high levels of active skincare ingredients; moisturize and smooth dehydrated skin; prime and perfect skin’s surface; camouflage and color correct the skintone; and protect skin from the sun with SPF. They can be used as a last step for their skincare benefits or used on their own as an instant beautifier.

The multitasking Naked Skin is like an instant retoucher in a tube. Optical blurring pigments instantly even out skintone and minimize the appearance of pores, lines, wrinkles, and redness. SPF 20 shields skin from sun damage and Pepha®-Protect helps inhibit DNA damage. Vitasource™ and Glyage® improve the appearance of skin's firmness and elasticity, and provide measurable antiaging benefits, while the extremely blendable formula creates a smooth finish, so makeup goes on beautifully and stays put. Moisturizing but never greasy, it hydrates skin instantly and improves hydration over time.
