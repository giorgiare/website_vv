What it is:
A three-in-one baked trio of bronzing powders featuring a combination of matte and shimmer shades to bronze, illuminate, and enhance skintone.

What it does:
This powder adds a touch of bronze and can be worn alone or dusted over foundation or moisturizer. This weightless powder contains three distinct bronzing powders with specialty pearls and pigments, which bronze the skin for a natural sun-tanned look or to help set foundation. The matte shade bronzes and warms the skin, the bronze shimmer helps enhance skintone, and the kitten shimmer brightens and illuminates the complexion. This luxurious powder also contains skin-loving Vitamin E and jojoba oils to help moisturize and condition the complexion.

What else you need to know:
This high-tech bronzer is packaged in a chic black compact with a mirror and an ingenious shaver that evenly distributes each shade and turns it into a fine, silky loose powder for effortless application.
