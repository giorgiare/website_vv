What it is:
A creamy powder luminizer that absorbs and reflects light for a superb natural glow. 

What it does:
Find refined luminosity in any light—this formula features ultra-fine luminescent pearls that absorb, reflect, and refract light so your natural radiance is never lost. Unlike the traditional pressed powder method which simply mixes and compresses dry ingredients, this unique process blends pigments with proprietary liquid binders, resulting in unparalleled, creamy application with balanced color dispersion. Like a compact full of crushed gemstones, the multi-toned, ultra-fine pigment pearls adjust to skin’s natural undertones for a truly unique glow. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
