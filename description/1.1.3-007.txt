What else you need to know:
“A good thing, made better: my bestselling, longtime favorite Argan Tinted Moisturizer is made with Argan Oil, so it moisturizes while it protects your skin from UVA and UVB rays. The new and improved version is formulated using an all-natural SPF 30—a rarity, since most foundations with SPF are loaded with chemicals. It sits lightly on your skin, so no clogged pores, and it comes in six shades, at least one of which is sure to suit the new and improved you.”—Josie Maran

Shade Conversions:
If you loved the previous Argan Tinted Moisturizer, here’s how to find your perfect shade:

Crème = Fair 1
Butter = Light 1
Butter = Light 2
Linen = Medium 1
Desert = Medium 2
Espresso = Dark 1

  If your previous shade was Butter and you are deciding between L1 and L2, use undertones as a reference: L1 is very close to Butter and works best with cool undertones; L2 is suited for neutral to warm undertones.
