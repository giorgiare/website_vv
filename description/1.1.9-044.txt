What it is:
A delicate bronzer, ideal for creating the warm and sensual Hollywood glow. 

What it does:
This remarkable formula imparts a feeling of indulgent decadence to the skin. Glow Bronzing Powder can be worn by day to illuminate the skintone, adding depth, or by night to exude radiance. The smooth powder delivers sunkissed warmth and a natural glow. Each shade is layered with golden pearl for a subtle shimmer, adding a glistening radiance to the complexion.

What else you need to know:
"A lighter shade of bronzer will create the most natural-looking tan. Build color gradually, starting at the temples, chin, and cheeks and then blend toward the center of the face using a large powder brush. Natural is the perfect shade for re-creating the subtle warmth seen at the Dolce & Gabbana shows."— Pat McGrath, Global Creative Advisor
