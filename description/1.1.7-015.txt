What it is:
A waterproof concealer powered by Amazonian clay, nature's most perfect ingredient, to balance and soothe skin.

What it does:
This waterproof, full-coverage concealer combines the calming properties of vitamins A and E and the soothing quality of Amazonian clay to nourish while completely masking discolorations and imperfections for better looking skin. Amazonian clay acts as a total skin balancer by reducing dryness and flakiness while improving the appearance and texture of skin for longer, waterproof wear! The buildable full-coverage formula is rich in pigments for truer color without a heavy or tacky texture, making it ideal for hiding any and all imperfections from dark circles to blemishes to redness. Designed for brush-free application, blending this creamy concealer with your finger allows the formula to melt into the skin for an easy application and opaque airbrushed effect.
