What it is:
A hydrating and correcting concealer with skincare benefits.

What it does:
Made with the same skin-perfecting ingredients as the foundation, the Diorskin Nude Concealer hides skin imperfections, including dark circles, to create a flawless canvas. These intensely moisturizing concealers, available in assorted shades, minimize the appearance of dark circles and puffiness and leave a smooth, velvety, ultra-natural finish.

What else you need to know:
This formula is composed of a mineralized water enriched with an exclusive and natural floral water that offers hydration, radiance, and elasticity to the skin. Unlike most concealers that use opaque pigments and create a mask-like effect, Diorskin Nude uses exclusive Nude-Glow pigments that are translucent. They allow the skin's natural radiance and color to shine through, appearing luminous in any light.
