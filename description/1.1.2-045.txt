What it is:
A natural-looking, long-wearing foundation. 

What it does:
Comfortable and hydrating, this medium- to full-coverage, oil-free formula never looks cakey or “masky.” Glycerin and shea butter keep skin feeling moisturized while a gel base creates a lightweight finish that stays color-true. This formula lasts for up to 12 hours even in the most humid conditions and protects skin from future damage thanks to broad spectrum SPF 15 with antioxidant vitamins C and E.
