The ultimate professional makeup tool. Skintones are perfect for dark circles and uneven skintone. Though it provides complete coverage, the texture is light, easy to blend, and won't irritate even the most sensitive skin.
Dany's Tip: "Camouflage Creams last longer when applied directly onto the skin before foundation, and blended with fingertips."

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
