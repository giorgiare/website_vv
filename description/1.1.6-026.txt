What it is:
A translucent mattifying powder. 

What it does:
This shine-stopping pressed powder blots oil and keeps shine at bay. The lavender shade applies invisibly and works on every skintone. Try it on naked skin (if you run into the hot guy at the gym), or over foundation (for touch ups on the dance floor without destroying your makeup). Because the formula contains super lightweight, oil-absorbing rice powder, you won't feel the powder, but you'll see the shine-free results. 

What else you need to know:
This powder comes in a gorgeous, transparent purple compact that seems to glow from within and features Urban Decay embellishments of skulls, flourishes, and flowers. Pop it open to reveal a mirror and handy puff applicator. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates
