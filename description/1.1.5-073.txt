What it is:
A lightweight, oil-free complexion corrector, which enhances the skin's texture and primes the skin for makeup application, is now offered in a convenient travel size.

What it does:
HD Microperfecting Primer deeply nourishes, moisturizes, and softens the skin, creating a glowing effect. It forms a protective layer on the skin, which allows foundation to glide on easily and last longer.

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
