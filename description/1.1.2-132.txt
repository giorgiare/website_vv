What it is:
A feather-light foundation that can be used wet or dry for a silk-like complexion or base of matte glamour. 

What it does:
This ultralight foundation glides effortlessly onto skin. Its formulation allows for buildable coverage, with a choice of textures. When applied dry, it imparts a soft, sheer effect. When applied wet, the complexion receives richer coverage and a flawless velvet finish. Using the skin as a canvas, the Perfect Finish Powder Foundation brings natural radiance to the forefront. 

What else you need to know:
“Used dry, this foundation is matte on the skin. Apply foundation powder only where it’s needed, focusing on the center of the forehead, the sides and tip of the nose, the sides of the cheeks, and the centre of the chin. Leave the upper cheekbones, brow bones, and bridge of the nose bare for a natural-looking glow. In the summer, use dry to help maintain a fresh, composed complexion that controls shine and sweat. Used wet, the foundation provides exceptionally flawless coverage. Moisten the sponge applicator with water, then swipe it over the pressed powder in a circular motion. Begin by applying it to the under eyes and sides of the nose, blending the foundation out to the rest of the face, where less coverage is needed."—Pat McGrath, Global Creative Advisor
