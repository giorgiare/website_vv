What it is: 
This lightweight translucent powder sets and evens foundation for extended wear. 

What it does: 
This finely milled formula has an even texture and a wisp of color to brighten and counteract both shine and dullness for a perfectly balanced, even, and subtly glowing complexion. The formula blends seamlessly over foundation to extend its wear and ensure continuous, natural-looking coverage. Available in universally flattering shades, the powder is sheer enough to suit every complexion. 

What else you need to know: 
"Set and perfect your foundation by applying the finishing powder with the brush over the entire face for matte, shine-free perfection, or use a soft touch of powder across high points on the face for a beautiful, brightening sheen."—Pat McGrath, Dolce & Gabbana Makeup Expert
