What it is:
A lightweight, creamy gel that creates an invisible barrier between skin and makeup to prime your face for color. 

What it does:
Worn under foundation, this illuminating primer creates a smooth, flawless canvas for application, allowing foundation to glide on easily and stay fresh and color-true for hours. Ideal for all skin types, the universal pearl tint creates a soft focus effect to minimize the look of imperfections with a radiant finish. It’s the first step to Laura’s “Flawless Face.” Dermatologist-tested and non-comedogenic, it is formulated with antioxidants vitamins A, C, and E; Prestige Soft Focus Pearls; and skin-conditioning Jojoba. 

What else you need to know:
Just as a painter primes a canvas, Foundation Primer—the original—was created by Laura Mercier in 1995 to prime the skin. After creating the industry’s first primer, she “reinvented” it and made a version that added soft highlights, luminosity, and radiance to skin. A lightweight, creamy vitamin-rich gel that prepares the skin for makeup application, it creates an even, invisible layer that acts as a buffer to outside elements and expertly holds foundation. This water-based formula not only keeps makeup staying fresh and color-correct for hours but also helps perfect skintone over time.
