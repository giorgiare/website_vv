What it is:
A lightweight, creamy gel that creates an invisible barrier between skin and makeup to prime your face for color. 

What it does:
Worn under foundation, this hydrating primer creates a smooth, flawless canvas for application, allowing foundation to glide on easily and stay fresh, keeping color true for hours. Ideal for drier skins, this hydrating formula nourishes with moisture-rich vitamins to soothe and condition. It’s the first step to Laura’s “Flawless Face.” Dermatologist-tested and non-comedogenic, it contains antioxidants vitamins A, C, and E and hydrating properties thanks to glycerin and hyaluronic acid. 

What else you need to know:
Just as a painter primes a canvas, Foundation Primer—the original—was created by Laura Mercier in 1995 to prime the skin. After creating the industry’s first primer, she “reinvented” it and made another version perfect for drier, dehydrated skin and customers who needed more hydration, moisture, and conditioning. She added soothing hydrators that offer anti-inflammatory benefits, help hold water in the skin, and nourish with a moisture-rich vitamin formula. The colorless gel acts as a buffer to outside elements, while vitamins A, C, and E act as antioxidants and protect the skin from the harmful, aging effects of the environment.
