To celebrate Tarte’s milestone cheek stain anniversary, they gave this cult favorite a makeover and launched a brand new shade. Tarte’s iconic flush cheek stain is the first product that Maureen launched from the brand out of her one-bedroom New York City apartment. Now, almost 15 years later, the Tarte team wanted to pay homage to its roots by giving each shade its own custom personality and design.
