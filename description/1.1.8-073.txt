What it is:
An innovative two-in-one matte bronzer and cheek tint in Park Ave Princess. 

What it does:
Transform into a glowing, bronze goddess. Infused with Amazonian clay and maracuja, this innovative double-agent complexion enhancer in Tarte’s signature Park Ave Princess shade will give you the perfect balance of sunkissed bronze and natural flush. Apply the weightless, mousse bronzer over foundation or smooth onto bare skin for an all-over matte radiance. Using the convenient blush tip, invigorate your complexion by applying the tint directly to cheeks and blending with fingertips for a subtle peachy pink glow. Maracuja instantly absorbs into the skin, delivering a high dose of essential fatty acids and vitamin C to hydrate the skin while imparting a beautiful pop of sheer color. By fusing two products into one, the recyclable component prevents the waste of potentially useful materials, making it the most eco-friendly and convenient bronzer and blush choice for the girl on the go.
