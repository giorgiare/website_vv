What it is:
A high-tech translucent powder that provides a stunning, soft-focus effect, even under bright and unforgiving light.

What it does:
Designed for the stars of film and flat screens, this high-tech finishing powder contains silky, microfine particles that fool the eyes with "optical blurring" and miraculously seem to airbrush away skin's imperfections. It provides a smooth, flawless, soft-focus finish that's flattering under even the harshest of lights. Use Razor Sharp as a finishing touch after foundation, or wear it alone to create a perfect "bare skin" look. However you apply it, you'll be addicted to the tiny refreshing water particles that float on skin's surface and "burst" when applied.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Synthetic Fragrances

What else you need to know:
The universal shade suits all skintones, so you're covered for summer and right into winter when your tan has faded. The no-mess component, with attached puff and handy on/off switch, is freeway- and subway-friendly so you can take it anywhere beauty calls.
