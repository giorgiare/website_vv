What it is:
A weightless, moisture-resistant setting spray with cooling time-release that works for up to 12 hours. 

What it does:
To stop makeup meltdown, just Chill. Perfect for drier or combination skin, Chill mists on to keep makeup from smudging or settling into fine lines. Temperature Control Technology actually chills the surface of your makeup to keep it looking gorgeously just-applied for up to 12 hours. Developed in an exclusive partnership with SKINDINÄVIA, this groundbreaking, clinically tested formula holds foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and concealer in place. The result? Vibrant makeup that lasts and a glowing, dewy, youthful complexion. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
Unlike similar products on the market that feel sticky or tight on your skin, the sprayer delivers a microfine mist that goes on so light, you’ll hardly feel it—and once you’ve applied it, you won’t even know it’s there. 

Research results:
In a 7-day clinical study of Chill:
- Over 83% of participants said Chill helped their makeup last for 12 hours without smudging or settling into fine lines
- 94% said Chill kept their makeup looking just-applied
- 88% said their concealer, foundation, shadow, and blush lasted longer too!
