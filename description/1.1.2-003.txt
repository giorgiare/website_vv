What it is:
A high-pigment foundation for full coverage with a long-lasting, beautiful finish. 

What it does:
Kat created this foundation to provide exceptional coverage, without compromising a smooth, striking finish. Formulated with 21 percent pigment, this powerful formula was developed to match a broad range of skintones with bold coverage—the proprietary pigments can even effectively cover tattoos. The combination of raw materials and the best siliconic elastomers and siliconic esters provide 24-hour wear with transfer resistance. Natural polymers absorb oil for a matte, soft finish and the added emollients provide a velvety texture for perfectly smooth, hydrated skin. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens 
- Synthetic Fragrances 

What else you need to know:
This foundation has been formulated to work synergistically with Kat’s Rehab Priming Elixir, Tattoo Concealer, and Lock ‘N Load Setting Mist.
