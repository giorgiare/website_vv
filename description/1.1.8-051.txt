What it is:
A "good karma" face powder.

What it does:
This powder in four shades–Lucky Shell, Divine Peach, Heavenly Rose and Berry Delight–blend together perfectly for an orchid-blossom blush with a soft satin finish. Swirl and sweep it on for a heavenly flush of enlightenment.

What else you need to know:
For an extra-angelic look, dot High Beam from cheekbones to temples. It's like a halo of highlighting!
