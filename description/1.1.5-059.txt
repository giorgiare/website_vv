What it is:
A light and comfortable spray that sets all types of makeup and prolongs hold, even under extreme conditions. 

What it is formulated to do:
With the alcohol-free formula, makeup is protected by a light, invisible film that feels comfortable on the skin. Enriched with chitosan, a marine algae extract, this makeup fixer spray protects skin against external damage caused by temperature changes, pollution, and other possible irritants.

Dany Sanz Tip:
For busy women who want to go from work to an evening dinner out and don't have time to go home for touch ups, spray mist and fix on a thick tissue and pat gently on the face to refresh your makeup. Then apply a veil of compact powder to give your complexion a velvety texture for the evening.
