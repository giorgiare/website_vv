A concealer that hides all imperfections and awakens the skin's youthfulness in a single step.

What it does:
Guerlain's new Precious Light Rejuvenating Illuminator hides all imperfections and awakens the skin's youthfulness with a single click of its magic wand brush. This must-have makeup tool employs an exclusive double-sided Gold Radiance Pigment: The opaque side targets imperfections and dull zones, toning down the appearance of wrinkles, dilated pores, and pigment irregularities, while the golden side reflects light. It contains a blend of myrrh oil, known for its regenerating properties, and lifting and soothing peptides, which together diminish the appearance of fine lines and create smoother, softer skin that lasts.
