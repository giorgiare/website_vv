What it is:
A perfectly coordinated duet of bronzing formulas in one compact for a seamless finish. 

What it does:
Infused with radiance-boosting minerals, sea coral, and green tea extract, these baked pigments sweep on weightless, natural-looking color—so you’ll be the picture of health. The fine pigments are carefully blended, infused with spring mineral water, shaped by hand, and then slowly cooked to achieve a unique, airy texture that effortlessly blends. The result is a flawless, no-makeup look and feel that wears comfortably day into night. Perfect as a finishing powder or worn alone, the pure, micronized pigments are so small that your complexion won’t look or feel cakey. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens 
- Synthetic Fragrances 

What else you need to know:
This compact contains one satin matte formula and one luminous bronzer, both of which can be used separately, or in tandem. Coverage can go from a natural glow to a deep rich tan, depending on the amount used.
