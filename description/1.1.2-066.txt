What it is:
A serum that helps recapture the luminous, radiant look of youthful skin.

What it does:
With its unique blend of antiaging ingredients (alpha longoza™ and centuline™), optical correctors, and HD liquid crystal pigments™, Dior Capture Totale Foundation is a revolutionary serum foundation that gives skin a radiant, high definition perfection in every dimension.

What else you need to know:
This revolutionary formula works, in part, thanks to a broad band of multitoned pigments that create a more subtle, real, and natural effect than the four-part pigment palette (red/yellow/white/black) usually used in foundation. Capture Totale Foundation also treats all the signs of aging, supports natural collagen, nourishes, replenishes, and visibly plumps skin. It's ideal for mature skin, dry skin, or dull skin that lacks radiance.
