What it is:
A new twist on setting powders, this three-in-one baked trio of correcting powders color-corrects, brightens, primes, evens skintone and sets makeup with a flawless, satin-like finish.

What it does:

This luxe powder also contains Vitamin E antioxidant benefits and jojoba oils to help moisturize and condition the skin.
