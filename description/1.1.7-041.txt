What it is:
A hydrating, ultra creamy, full-coverage concealer. 

What it does:
This deeply hydrating, never-cakey, buildable, color-correcting concealer forgives all skin sins—dark circles, blemishes, and uneven pigment—without masking your face. Creamy, blendable, and luminous, it comes with a self-sharpening, twist-up tip so you'll always be on-point. 

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates 
- Phthalates 

What else you need to know:
“As a kid, I had one of those giant boxes of crayons with the built-in sharpener. I loved coloring (especially outside the lines!), but when I tried to sharpen my crayons, the points broke off.  No more! My Argan Creamy Concealer Crayon sharpens itself when you twist it. It's a superportable, superblendable, superhydrating, Argan Oil-infused, full coverage concealer.” –Josie Maran
