What it is: 
A high-performance primer that feels amazing on the skin. 

What it does: 
This silicone-free, water-based formula brings a refreshing burst of hydration and as it firms and absorbs excess oil in the skin. Fast-acting hydrators give an instant soft, supple texture to the skin while pore tightening ingredients prep the skin for perfect foundation application. The absence of silicon in the formula ensures a lightweight texture that won’t clog pores and a matte finish that will last throughout the day. Use alone for a fresh, natural look or before foundation for a smooth, flawless palette. 

What else you need to know: 
This formula is made in France and is ideal for all skin types.
