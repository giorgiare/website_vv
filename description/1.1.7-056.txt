What it is:
A medium-coverage concealer that brightens and covers imperfections for a natural, radiant look. 

What it does:
Offering complete control in a convenient, portable click-pen, this creamy water-resistant formula does more than just cover dark circles under the eyes and spot-conceals other areas. With a mix of innovative powders, it creates a soft naturally radiant look. The smooth texture blends seamlessly, matching all skintones. The water-resistant formula offers invisible, smudge- and crease-proof coverage that is quick-absorbing and non-greasy. This product is free of parabens, fragrance, talc, and D5. 

What else you need to know:
This product is enriched with antioxidant vitamin E to nourish skin’s natural repair process, discourage inflammation, and enhance moisture retention while protecting against pollution and free radical damage. Orgasol® Restore, a new patent-pending technology, helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while making skin look more toned and supple. Orgasol Restore also helps replace ceramides, preserving hydration and preventing moisture loss. A nutrient-rich blend from jojoba, mimosa, and sunflower plants create a light touch, leaving skin feeling exceptionally soft.
