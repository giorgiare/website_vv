A duo for boosting the complexion with a rosy and luminous glow.

What it does:
This two-in-one delivery system hydrates the skin while adding a beautiful radiance whenever you need it. Apply the tint to cheeks over foundation or on bare skin, and blend with fingertips to create a natural flush. Use the luminizer to highlight the top of the cheekbones or browbones, on the Cupid's bow of the lips, or add a few drops to your foundation for allover glow. Maracuja oil instantly absorbs into the skin for a high dose of essential fatty acids and vitamin C.
