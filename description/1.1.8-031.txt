What it is:
A duet of blush formulas in one compact for a variety of radiant finishes. 

What it does:
Infused with radiance-boosting minerals, sea coral, and green tea extract, these baked pigments sweep on weightless, natural-looking color—so you’ll be the picture of health. The duo combines a luminizer to highlight cheekbones and a matte satin blush to contour and define. The ulta-light, micronized pigments blend effortlessly into the skin to enhance skintone and give you a flawless, no-makeup look and feel. Customize your glow by blending the matte blush with the luminous formula for a perfect finish, or use them separately to achieve different looks for day and night. The fine pigments were infused with spring water, shaped by hand, and then slowly cooked for the unique, airy texture that melts into skin. Enhance your natural features with this duo and enjoy the seamless, breathable finish all day.
