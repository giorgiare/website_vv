What it is:
A lightweight tinted moisturizer that addresses signs of aging.

What it does:
More than a BB cream, this new generation of multifunction tinted skincare product moisturizes, lifts, illuminates, and instantly evens skintone. Created with lifting and color-correcting Multi-Tension technology designed to target upper layers of the skin, this multiaction formula helps skin feel firmer and denser, as if lifted. Wrinkles appear reduced, and skin’s texture feels smoother.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Sulfates
- Synthetic Dyes
- Phthalates
- GMOs
- Triclosan 

What else you need to know:
Lancôme laboratories has innovated "bio-chromatic technology" in this product to even the complexion. As we age, skin loses its natural, youthful color and each person’s skintone evolves differently. Lancôme color specialists have developed this technology to allow skin to capture light and correct color changes due to aging.

Rénergie Éclat is available in four shades for all skintones, from fair to deep:
- Fair/rosy skin: Shade 1 tones down redness
- Fair/beige skin: Shade 2 neutralizes yellowing
- Golden/beige skin: Shade 3 illuminates olive tones
- Golden/dark skin: Shade 4 awakens gray tones
