What it is:
An all-in-one eraser, brightener, and corrector to remedy the signs of aging, dehydration, and fatigue. 

What it does:
One of Marc’s favorite products, Remedy Concealer Pen is the perfect fix for the sins of a carefree youth or just the aftermath of last night. Formulated with advanced pigments, powerful antioxidants, and Remedy Complex™—a unique blend of hydrating and antiaging ingredients—this next-generation concealer brightens, hydrates, and soothes the skin while providing the coverage you need for a fresh, bright-eyed finish. The patented palladium applicator cools on contact to reduce puffiness and one click is all it takes for the perfect amount of product. Boy tested. Girl approved. 

What else you need to know:
The two universal brightening and correcting shades flatter all skintones, while the versatile shade range complements most skintones. 

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
