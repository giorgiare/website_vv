What it is:
A multitasking Amazonian clay finishing powder.

What it does:
Smooth Operator™ Amazonian clay finishing powder in bronze perfects and mattifies while bronzing the skin, imparting a healthy, natural warmth. This silky powder sets makeup, minimizes pores and fine lines, and is ideal for someone who wants a natural-looking hint of sun without shimmer. It's perfect for all skin types and tones and never looks chalky. Amazonian clay, nature's most perfect ingredient, acts as a total skin balancer by reducing dryness and flakiness, improving clarity and texture, and removing surface oil for a soft focus and lit-from-within finish; all while replenishing and rehydrating skin. This skin-saving powder can even be used alone as a treatment to reap all the benefits of Amazonian clay.
