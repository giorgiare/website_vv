What it is:
A mineral pressed powder that harnesses Koh Gen Do’s newest advanced powder technology.

What it does:
This powder combines three subtle shades to give a natural high-polished sheer finish that also diffuses fine lines and pores like a perfect veil. Clear Keeping Powder prevents a dull finish caused by oil and sweat accumulation. A pearlescent Clear Luminous Powder helps keep the skin’s glow for hours. And Mirror Ball Powder, a round-shaped powder with a scale-like reflective surface creates a prismatic light giving a soft-focus effect to the skin. It diminishes the appearance of pores, fine lines, and uneven surfaces that give off a shadow. In addition, four specifically cut powders (oil controlling, water-resistant, amino acid, and moisture coating) work to create this high-definition finish.

What else you need to know:
