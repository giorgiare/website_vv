What it is:
A long-wearing liquid foundation to create a radiant, flawless complexion with a smooth, satiny finish. 

What it does:
Every woman dreams of having a “beautyguard” for her complexion who goes with her everywhere, all day and into the night. Far from being just another long-hold formula, Teint Couture is a new way of thinking about foundation: a true balancing act, combining long-hold with comfort and a light feel—it wasn’t easy, but Givenchy did it.

Active ingredients with a strong affinity for the skin’s surface provide “magnetic” adherence, becoming one with the contours of the face while remaining supple. Soft-focus agents visually refine the skin’s texture and conceal imperfections while a hydro-magnetic complex moisturizes and rebalances the skin cells day after day, helping them withstand everyday stress factors, and for added protection, a SPF20 sunscreen. The complexion is perfectly smoothed, unified, and lustrous, with a satiny, natural finish while imperfections are concealed with no excess buildup. Decidedly Haute Couture, Teint Couture Long-Wearing Liquid Foundation dresses up the skin with perfect coverage and hold that lasts up to 15 hours.
