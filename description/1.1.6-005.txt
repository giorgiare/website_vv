What it is:
A three-time award-winning universal translucent finishing powder to be applied over foundation or worn alone. 

What it does:
This industry-recognized luxe finishing powder sets the foundation and slightly mattifies skin without changing its natural contours. Made of 100 percent-mineral silica, it softens the appearance of imperfections, fine lines, and pores and completely evens out the complexion for a glowing, radiant look. This translucent, dermatologist-tested, and talc-free formula does not dry the skin. One universal shade works for all skintones. The lightweight, silky texture and ultrafine formula adds a soft focus effect for a flawless finish and can be applied over foundation or worn alone. 

Sephora is the exclusive beauty retailer for this product.
