What it is:
A beautiful bronzing powder. 

What it does:
This powder is like Barbados in a box! Sweep Hoola across the chin, cheeks, and forehead with the accompanying brush for a healthy, natural looking tan year-round— no tanning bed necessary. 

What else you need to know:
Always tap off excess powder to avoid applying too much color. This is a contouring bronzer that can also be used to highlight features of your face.
