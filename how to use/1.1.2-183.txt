Suggested Usage:
-Apply Skin Veil on the T-zone (forehead and nose) and fade outwards with the brush or fingertips to provide sufficient and natural-looking coverage.
-Within just a few minutes, Skin Veil becomes one with the skin (apply a second layer for a more coverage).
-Use the foundation and concealer of the same color in combination for a seamless coverage on any skintone.
