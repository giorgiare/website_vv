Suggested Usage:
-Dark: For dark undereye circles. Neutralizes bluish dark shadows. (Apply a lighter concealer or foundation after this shade is applied, being careful not to blend but stipple/dab the color on top to cover.)
-Medium: Cover discolorations.
-Light: Use as a base on the eyelids to even and brighten. Apply around the nasolabial fold to diffuse the line.
