Suggested Usage:
-To prime in the morning: Apply a thin layer of this PRO balm to moisturized skin from the center of the face outward. Wait a few seconds and apply makeup as usual or wear alone.
-To touch up over makeup: If pores come out of hiding, pat delicately over makeup on problem areas and blend. Remember, just a dab’ll do ya!
-To smooth on a brighter face: Give your POREfect complexion an instant perk-me-up! Layer the POREfessional smoothing balm over "That Gal" Brightening Face Primer.
-To lock down your look: To help foundation stay put, always start with the POREfessional. Then blend Hello Flawless Oxygen Wow from the center of the face, out. Skin will look smooth and flawless all day long.
-To spot-conceal: Apply the POREfessional over blemishes, then blend Boi-ing on top. It'll keep skin looking smooth and lock the industrial-strength concealer in place.
- To rock the photo op: Prime face with the POREfessional to minimize the look of pores and mattify skin. Apply your favorite Benefit makeup products...then reapply the POREfessional. The lens will love you!
