-Using the applicator, apply a small amount around the entire eye, both on the lid and below.
-Massage into the skin by smoothing the upper eyelid, from the inner to the outer corner, and lower eyelid using a light tapping motion from the exterior inwards. 
- To correct noticeable dark circles, re-apply a small amount, targeting the darker areas of the skin and then tap to blend. 
-For brighter, wider-looking eyes, apply to the outer corner and blend toward the temples.
