Suggested Usage:
Touch-Up Application:
-Begin with the sponge side of the applicator by picking up the powder from the compact using a dabbing motion.
-Lightly press onto the back of the hand to evenly disperse the product into the applicator.
-Next, using a light patting motion, gently press the powdered sponge onto the oily areas of the face; focusing on the forehead, cheeks and chin.
-As a finishing step, use the flocked, puff side of the applicator to softly buff away any excess powder for a matte, flawless finish.
Preventative Application:
For those with extremely oily skin, lightly dust Smooth Focus Pressed Setting Powder - Shine Control over foundation using the Finishing Brush before color application.
