Suggested Usage:
-Use a large fluffy brush and lightly dust finishing powder over skin alone as a treatment or over concealer and foundation to keep makeup in place and add a natural finish.
-For targeted application, use your ring finger to gently pat finishing powder over undereye or blemish concealer to keep product from migrating into fine lines, wrinkles, and dry skin.
