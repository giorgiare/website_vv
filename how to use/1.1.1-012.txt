Suggested Usage:
-Treat and prep: Apply the maracuja rollerball directly to clean, dry skin in circular motions, massaging under and around the eyes, the corners of the nose and mouth, and onto the cheeks.
-Perfect: Dispense a dime-size amount of foundation to the back of your hand. Pick up a small amount using the Airbrush Finish Foundation Brush and sweep onto skin with a light circular motion starting at the center of the face and blending outward to achieve complexion perfection.
-Volumize and define: Apply two coats of gifted Amazonian clay mascara beginning at the base and moving the brush in zigzag motions through the lashes.
