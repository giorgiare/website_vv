Suggested Usage:
-Apply bronzer powder using Guerlain's foolproof "figure 3 method." Start by applying your Terracotta powder by tracing a figure three on each side of the face: from the forehead down towards the cheeks, then down along the jaw line to the chin and down the neck.
-For the finishing touch, take a little more Terracotta powder with your brush and sweep it over the raised areas of the face, the places that catch the sun most—the forehead, nose, cheekbones and chin.
-The result is an instant glow—the perfect application in only seconds.
