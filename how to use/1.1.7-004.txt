Suggested Usage:
-Choose a color two shades lighter than your complexion.
-Apply to clean, makeup-free skin with a brush or fingertip for best results.
-Smooth edges to spread the color evenly so the product blends with the skin.
-Top with loose powder to set.
-Reapply if necessary.

Tips:
-Try blending a couple of shades together for the perfect match.
-For larger scars, apply a paler color to the edges and a darker color on the scar itself using one or two nylon brushes. Smooth the edges and blend the colors together for a totally uniform effect.
