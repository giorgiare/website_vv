Suggested Usage:
-Use a dab on your problem areas, or smooth all over. A little goes a long way—a pea-sized drop of this formula is all you need for your entire face (or, try just a touch in the areas where you need it most).
-Apply to bare skin before liquid, mineral, or powder foundation. Or, use it alone.
