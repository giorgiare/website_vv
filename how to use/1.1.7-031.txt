Suggested Usage:
-Apply on bare skin or over foundation.
-Touch on with brush where skin needs brightening cover: inner and outer corners of eye, sides of nose, etc. Or, finger-blend into skin using a light, patting motion.
-Build coverage by adding more when needed.
-Avoid rubbing once application is complete.
-Note: The first application usually requires several full turns to initially dispense product on the brush applicator. Subsequent applications require only 4 to 5 clicks, not full turns.
