Suggested Usage: 
-Prepare skin with Veil Mineral Primer. 
-Apply one pump of foundation to the back of your hand. 
-Working in sections of the face, apply a small amount using fingertips, blend and repeat. Work quickly, as Immaculate immediately transforms from liquid to powder as you blend. 
-Apply with the Hourglass Foundation Brush for an airbrushed finish. Sponge application is not recommended.
