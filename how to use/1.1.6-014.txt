Suggested Usage:
-Apply after makeup.
-Invert powder canister and tap gently to allow powder to gather in tray.
-Dip Powder Brush or included brush in powder, gently tap off excess, and apply to face.
-For the most flawless look, use Clinique's Powder Rubdown technique: Pour powder into palm of hand, coat fingertips with powder, and then gently pat and smooth fingertips over skin. Brush off excess.
Note: Brush can hold a single application of loose powder for later use. Dip into powder, twist down, and cover with lid. Carry "loaded" brush in your evening bag or makeup pouch.
