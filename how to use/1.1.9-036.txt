Suggested Usage:
-Turn the shaver in a clockwise motion to release powder.
-Using a Stila #24 blush brush, lightly press brush into shaved powder and tap off any excess.
-For a natural-looking glow, apply a light dusting over areas of the face where the sun hits, such as the cheeks, nose and forehead.
-For an allover, straight-from-the beach look, sweep powder onto the neck, décolletage or all over the body. 
-This bronzer can be used alone or over your favorite Stila foundation.
