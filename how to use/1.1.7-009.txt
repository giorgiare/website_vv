Suggested Usage:
-Step 1: Prep
-Starting with a clean, dry area, apply a full coverage base in a neutralizing color. On a tattoo, try a pink-toned liner. Follow along the edges of the tattoo, and fill in the area. Finish by blending with the Kat Von D concealer brush.
-Step 2: Conceal
-Apply Kat Von D Tattoo Concealer over the tattoo and surrounding area using the concealer brush. Use a Rock and Roll technique to apply the concealer, fading it out around the edges. Let the concealer dry down completely between layers. Reapply as necessary to achieve complete coverage.
-Step 3: Perfect
-With a sponge, Rock and Roll the correct shade of a mattifying powder foundation over the area to set the concealer. Buff with a bronzing brush, making sure not to over blend.
-Step 4: Set
-Seal in your work and extend wear by applying a fixing mist over the entre area. See the results for yourself!
