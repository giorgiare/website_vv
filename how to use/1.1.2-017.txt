Suggested Usage:
-Tap brush on foundation until bristles are lightly coated.
-Buff gently onto skin with long, graceful strokes for buildable coverage.
-Leslie’s Pro Tips for foundation application: For sheer-to-medium coverage, use the Flawless Application Face Brush, which has soft, tapered bristles for soft, even application all over face. For medium-to-full coverage, use the Precision Face Brush. Its silky synthetic bristles are angled to fit the contours of your face for precise coverage.
