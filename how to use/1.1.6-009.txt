Suggested Usage:
-Wear Naked Skin Loose Finishing Powder over Naked Skin Liquid Makeup (or Naked Skin Beauty Balm) to set your makeup and help it last, or try this silky formula on bare skin. Either way, your skin will look flawless—even under bright, unforgiving light.
-For a flawless application, use Urban Decay’s Good Karma Optical Blurring Brush.
