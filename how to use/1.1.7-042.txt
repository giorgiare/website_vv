Suggested Usage:
For use with a foundation: 
-User of compact foundation: apply the concealer before the compact foundation. 
-User of liquid foundation: apply the concealer after the liquid foundation. 

For use as an anti-dark circle product: 
-Choose one to two tones lighter than your complexion, in yellowish hues (or porcelain for very light complexion) because the dark circle is a crease that creates a shadow. Therefore, to hide this shadow, brighten it with a light color. 
-Apply the product by looking upwards and blend it up to the base of the eye. 

To hide blemishes: 
-With fingertips, apply the concealer to the small areas that need coverage and then tap gently until it blends in and completely hides the blemish. 

To hide dark circles: 
-Apply a drop of the product to the inner corner of the eye and then blend it by tapping gently on the entire eye contour up to the eyelid.
