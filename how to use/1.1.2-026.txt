Suggested Usage:
-One Pump to Perfection: Because this formula is so highly concentrated, you only need a fraction of the amount you would use with traditional foundations.
-With The One Perfecting Brush, apply one pump directly to the bristles and buff into the skin.
-For more buildable coverage, apply pump to the back of the hand, sweep bristles over foundation and apply to face, adding as necessary.
