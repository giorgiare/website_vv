Suggested Usage:
-Sweep the Face Blender Brush through all five shades and dust lightly on cheekbones after blush.
-Focus on applying shimmer on the top of cheekbones, where light naturally hits the face, for the most flattering look.
-To add a highlight to eyes, apply the lightest shade in the compact just under brow bone with fingertips or the Eye Smudge Brush.
