Suggested usage:
Ten ways to use Mineral Veil:
-Apply after bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation to prolong the wear of your foundation.
-Apply before bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation to absorb oil leaving you shine-free all day.
-Buff it onto your scalp to absorb excess oil between washings.
-Pat it onto your eyelids before applying Eyecolors to prevent oily lids.
-To prevent fall-out from Eyecolors, sweep a heavy application of Mineral Veil under your eyes before applying bareMinerals Eyecolors and Liner Shadows.
-Once you have completed your eye look, just brush away the excess Mineral Veil and any fall-out disappears.
-Layer it between lip color applications to prevent feathering and to extend the wear; place a tissue over lips, buff on Mineral Veil, apply lip color, and repeat.
-Bring it with you to freshen up your skin throughout the day.
-Buff it on to perfect the skin for photos, infusing the skin with softness and light.
-Minimize the look of pores by applying with the Maximum Coverage Face Brush to target area (i.e. t-zones).
-In extremely hot climates, buff it on before bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation to absorb perspiration throughout the day for cool, comfortable skin.
