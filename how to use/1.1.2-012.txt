Suggested Usage:
-Always apply dry (do not wet the sponge or brush).
-Apply a maximum of one or two layers to the whole face with the sponge.
-Apply a single, lighter layer around the eyes (too much will accentuate fine lines).
-For an ultra-sheer result, apply with a powder brush.

Professional tip from Dany Sanz:
-Duo Mat can be used on oily skin instead of ordinary powder for an extra-matte finish. 
-For even application, avoid applying the foundation over rich, oil-based face creams.
