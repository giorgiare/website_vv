Suggested Usage:
-Always apply concealer after foundation, targeting only the areas that need a little extra coverage.
-For the perfect application, first apply concealer to targeted area using a brush, then gently press into the skin using the fingertip in a rolling motion.
-Layer on as little product as possible and reapply if additional coverage is needed.
-Artist tip: Always set with a powder to ensure concealer adheres to the skin for an all-day finish.
