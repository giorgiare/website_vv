Suggested Usage:
-After skin prep, use sponge or brush to blend foundation into skin, starting from the center and radiating out toward face line.
-Make sure all angles of lines, pores, and uneven skin surfaces are covered.
Can be used also as a 'touch up' powder during the day or to set Moisture Foundation for more coverage.
