Suggested Usage:
-Choose a concealer that is one or two shades lighter. This will help brighten dark circles under the eye.
-Artist Tip: Remember that the skin under the eyes is very delicate, so never tug or pull when blending in your concealer. Simply pat the eye area using your ring finger until your concealer disappears.
