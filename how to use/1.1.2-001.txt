Suggested Usage:
-SWIRL a small amount of bareMinerals in the lid with the Flawless Application Face Brush until all the bareMinerals are tucked into the bristles.
-TAP away excess. There should be no visible bareMinerals on the outside of the brush.
-BUFF the bareMinerals into the skin in a circular motion, starting on the outside of your face near your cheekbone, swirling as you go. Buff around your face and then approach your forehead, cheeks, and nose. Buff, buff, buff until you are satisfied with the coverage.
-*Remember less is more when applying bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation.
